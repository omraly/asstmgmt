        "\n",
        "- *Popularity*: Python is one of the most popular programming languages ([Source](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/)) and is extensively used in the financial services industry and asset management.\n",
        "- *Transferable skills*: You will acquire the concepts (such as variables, data types, loops, if-statements, ...), which other programming languages also have. Thus, if you work for a company that happens to use a different programming language, you will be able to transition quickly.\n",
        "- *Package ecosystem*: Python has a rich and well-developed package ecosystem. Packages help you to use code that others have already written, which helps to save a lot of time with common problems.\n",
        "- *Open source*: There is no license required to run Python. Thus, you can run it on as many computers as you like, don't need to renew it, and are not dependent on your university or employer to pay for a subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What can Python be used for in your studies?\n",
        "- Empirical seminar or master theses can be done in Python.\n",
        "- It could be the difference between you getting the internship or someone else.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### What can Python be used for in your future career?\n",
        "- *Data analysis*: Handling, cleaning and analyzing large datasets is very easy.\n",
        "- *Automation*: Due to its flexibility, almost anything can be automated in Python. For example, generating reports from a large number of input files\n",
        "- *Machine learning*: Python is the most popular language for working with (and developing) machine learning models. Just ask ChatGPT \"Which language was ChatGPT programmed in?\" -> Python.\n",
        "- *Asset management*: Many uses in asset management, such as algorithmic trading, backtesting, and portfolio optimization."
